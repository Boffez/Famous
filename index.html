<p>Lech Wałęsa is a Polish statesman, Nobel Peace Prize laureate, and a symbol of resistance against oppression. Born on September 29, 1943, in Popowo, Poland, Wałęsa worked as an electrician at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk during the 1970s. His life took a transformative turn when he became the leader of <em>Solidarność</em> (Solidarity), the first independent trade union in the Soviet Bloc, sparking a movement that ultimately contributed to the fall of communism in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>A charismatic leader and advocate for workers&#39; rights, Wałęsa faced numerous challenges, including arrests and surveillance by Poland’s communist government.
